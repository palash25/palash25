### Hello ðŸ‘‹

- I am working on [PMM](https://www.percona.com/software/database-tools/percona-monitoring-and-management) as a Backend Engineer at [Percona](https://www.percona.com/)
- I mostly write [Go](https://golang.org/) prior to that I used to do a little [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) but being a programming language enthusiast I am constantly playing around with other languages.
- These days I am learning [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/)
- Other languages that I find interesting and would like to learn someday are [Zig](https://ziglang.org/), [Pony](https://www.ponylang.io/), [Clojure](https://clojure.org/), [Erlang](https://www.erlang.org/), [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/), [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/), [Scala](https://scala-lang.org/), [Lua](https://www.lua.org/about.html), [Ocaml](https://ocaml.org/), [F#](https://fsharp.org/), [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/), [Common Lisp](https://common-lisp.net/) and [Julia](https://julialang.org/).
- Besides programming languages I am also studying databases and distributed systems in general.
- [WASM](https://webassembly.org/) also seems cool and is on my list of things to learn
- Pronouns: He/Him
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Besides Twitter I am pretty active on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/palash25) feel free to DM me if you have any questions
