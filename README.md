### Hello Hello ðŸ‘‹

- I am Palash, I work as a Backend Engineer at [Percona](https://www.percona.com/) on [PMM](https://www.percona.com/software/database-tools/percona-monitoring-and-management)
- I mostly write Go (before which I used to do a little Python and Ruby) but being a programming language enthusiast I am constantly playing around with other languages.
- These days I am learning Rust and Elixir
- Other languages that interests me and I would like to learn someday are Zig, Pony, Clojure, Erlang, Nim, Haskell, Scala, Lua, Ocaml, F# and Julia.
- Besides programming languages I am also studying databases and distributed systems in general.
