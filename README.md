### Hello ðŸ‘‹

- I mostly write [Go](https://golang.org/) prior to that I used to do a little [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) but being a programming language enthusiast I am constantly playing around with other languages.
- These days I am learning [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/)
- Other languages that I find interesting and would like to learn someday are [Zig](https://ziglang.org/), [Pony](https://www.ponylang.io/), [Clojure](https://clojure.org/), [Erlang](https://www.erlang.org/), [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/), [Ocaml](https://ocaml.org/), [Prolog](https://www.swi-prolog.org/) and  [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/).
- Besides programming languages I am also studying databases and distributed systems.
