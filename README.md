### Hello ðŸ‘‹

- I work as a Backend Engineer at [Percona](https://www.percona.com/) working on [PMM](https://www.percona.com/software/database-tools/percona-monitoring-and-management)
- I mostly write Go (before which I used to do a little Python and Ruby) but being a programming language enthusiast I am constantly playing around with other languages.
- These days I am learning Rust and Elixir
- Other languages that interests me and I would like to learn someday are Zig, Pony, Clojure, Erlang, Nim, Haskell, Scala, Lua, Ocaml, F#, Racket/Common Lisp and Julia.
- Besides programming languages I am also studying databases and distributed systems in general.
- WASM also seems cool and is on my list of things to learn
- Pronouns: He/Him
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Besides Twitter I am pretty active on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/palash25) feel free to DM me if you have any questions
